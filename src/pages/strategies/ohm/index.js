      <Subtitle>Hedged OHM Farming</Subtitle>
      <p>The APY for staking <a href="https://www.olympusdao.finance/">OlympusDAO's OHM</a> is around 7000% at the time of writing. That's massive, and investors would be wise to get exposure to this! But there's a catch: the returns are in OHM. So if the price of OHM goes down (which it is expected to), your profits are eroded.</p>
      <p>To mitigate this, you can short OHM. <a href="https://float.capital">Float Capital</a> offers a leveraged OHM market, where you can open a 2x-leveraged short position. If you size this position perfectly you will have negative price exposure equal to your positive price exposure, equating to a delta-neutral position: if the price of OHM increases, you will not make any money from that movement, and if the price of OHM decreases you will not lose any money from that movement.</p>
      <p>That leaves you with a risk-free exposure to just the OHM staking rewards. So you can farm OHM confidently, knowing that your bags won't be affected if the price of OHM decreases.</p>

If you don't have Polygon DAI, you can bridge Ethereum mainnet assets over to Polygon and use a <abbr title="Decentralised EXchange">DEX</abbr> such as <a href="https://quickswap.exchange">Quickswap</a> to swap them for DAI, or buy it from a <abbr title="Centralised EXchange">CEX</abbr> like <a href="https://ramp.network">Ramp</a></>,

          OHM's four-figure APY is awesome. But, holding OHM comes with price risk.
          What if the price of OHM drops? By holding OHM, you're effectively betting
          on the price of OHM going up. If it goes down, you lose money.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, the legends at{" "}
          <a href="https://float.capital" target="_blank">
            Float Capital
          </a>{" "}
          let you bet on the price of OHM <em>going down</em> by minting a{" "}
          <a href="https://float.capital/app/markets?marketIndex=2&actionOption=short">
            <em>short position</em> on the OHM market
          </a>. If you put just the right
          amount into betting on the price of OHM going down, your two bets going in
          opposite directions will cancel out! Then, you will be financially
          unaffected by the price of OHM. This is called being "delta neutral". When
          you're delta neutral, you can just enjoy the sweet APY rewards of holding
          staked OHM, without ever having to worry about the price of OHM.
        </p>

          This calculator computes the exact right size of the short position you
          should mint on Float Capital to be delta neutral.
